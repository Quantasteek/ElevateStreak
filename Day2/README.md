**Target:-**

1. Setup basic HTML with input, add button, and list container.

2. Style layout with CSS for clarity.

3. Use JS to add event listeners on the Add button.

4. Append new tasks as list items dynamically.

5. Implement functionality to mark tasks complete (toggle class).

6. Add remove button for each task to delete it.

7. Test adding, completing, and deleting tasks.

8. Ensure UI updates instantly without page reload.


**Extra additions:-**

- Edit todos using dialog box.

- Segregate todos into All, Active and Completed tabs.

- Add todos to localStorage so refresh doesn't cause refresh of todos.
